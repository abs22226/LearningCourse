# LearningCourse
This repository contains all the projects of the "PRO C#. ООП на практике" learning course.  
- **_GeniusIdiot_** is a humorous quiz in Russian language designed to assess a user's intellectual abilities. Actually, these are two applications (Console and WinForms) having the same functionality and sharing a common library. To add, store and delete quiz questions as well as user's information and results I used file system operations and studied serialization/deserialization in JSON format. Also I used a timer to limit the user's responses by time.
