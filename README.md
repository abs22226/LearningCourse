# LearningCourse
This repository contains all the projects of the "PRO C#. ООП на практике" learning course.  
- GeniusIdiot is a humorous quiz in Russian language designed to assess a user's intellectual abilities. Actually, these are two applications (Console and WinForms) with a common library and the same functionality. To add, store and delete quiz questions, information about users and their results, I used work with the file system and studied serialization/deserialization in JSON format.
